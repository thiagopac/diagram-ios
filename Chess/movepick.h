/// MovePicker is a class which is used to pick one legal move at a time from
/// the current position.  It is initialized with a Position object and a few
/// moves we have reason to believe are good.  The most important method is
/// MovePicker::pick_next_move(), which returns a new legal move each time it
/// is called, until there are no legal moves left, when MOVE_NONE is returned.
/// In order to improve the efficiency of the alpha beta algorithm, MovePicker
/// attempts to return the moves which are most likely to be strongest first.
